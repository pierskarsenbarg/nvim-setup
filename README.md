# My Neovim setup

Some sections lovingly lifted from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

To use: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierskarsenbarg/nvim-setup.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

Adding it here because it might come in use for future Piers, or someone else.
